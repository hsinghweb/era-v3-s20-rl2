# 🚗 AI-Powered Self-Driving Car Simulation 🏎️  

This project implements a **self-driving car simulation** using **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** and visualizes its learning process with **Kivy**. The AI agent learns to navigate a track by using sensor inputs and optimizing its movement through reinforcement learning.  

## 📌 Features  
✅ **Virtual Environment** - The car navigates based on sensor inputs.  
✅ **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** - AI learns to drive using reinforcement learning.  
✅ **Replay Memory & Exploration** - Ensures better decision-making.  
✅ **Dynamic Reward System** - Optimized for better training efficiency.  
✅ **Neural Network Enhancement** - Added extra layers to improve performance.  
✅ **Debugging & Fixes** - Fixed incorrect car positioning, transposed matrices, and tuned hyperparameters.
