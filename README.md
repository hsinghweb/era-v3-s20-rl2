# ERAv3 Reinforcement Learning & Self-Driving Lab

## Project Overview
Combines classic reinforcement learning environments with a self-driving car simulation:
- **Reinforcement Learning** implementations (Gridworld)
- **Self-Driving Car** simulation with Kivy-based UI
- Modular architecture with separation between agents and environments

## Basic Usage
### Reinforcement Learning
```bash
python reinforcement/gridworld.py
```

### Self-Driving Simulation
```bash
cd self_driving_car
python ai.py
```
